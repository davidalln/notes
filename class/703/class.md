Week II - 2/13/17
-----------------

We want to promote scientific ***inquiry***. Our goal is to encourage "little scientists and mathemeticians" -- develop the mind.

### The Learning Cycle

+ ***EXPLORATION***: You want to "capture the student's mind." We want to use past experience from the students. "You have to elicit those moments, you have to begin to carve a notch in those minds."
+ ***CONCEPT INTRODUCTION***: "You introduce the concept by providing very common, direct teaching strategies (movies, literature, powerpoints, etc)" Uses formal terminology, "big words".
+ ***APPLICATION***

Students learn from creating a "disequilibrium", where that which they observe in their exploration doesn't match what their world view is. In the concept introduction, an equilibrium is reached, and the application reinforces the new world view.

### FERA Learning Cycle

+ ***Focus The Topic***: Focus in on those past experiences.
+ ***Explore***
+ ***Reflect***
+ ***Apply***

### 5E (BSCS) Learning Cycle

Engage -> Explore -> Explain -> Elaborate -> Evaluate

****IT'S ALL ABOUT SELF REGULATION!****

When designing the lesson, you cannot state the objective first. You need to keep them in suspense! Otherwise they will tune out (don't tell them you're going to make a volcano, focus/engage it first)

Lessons must be developmentally appropriate (Piaget's Stages of Cognitive Development).

STEM education is based on a "constructivist" view of knowledge.

### Scientific Enterprise

Science is the process by which we gather new knowledge. At the base of this are facts (hard/soft, size, etc). Many facts make up concepts.

Facts -> Concepts -> Generalizations -> Theory -> Laws
