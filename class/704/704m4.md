### Chapter 6: Survivors / Chapter 7: The Boy Who Ate a Giant Bag of Cookies While He Walked Me All Around the Neighborhood, and His Very Interesting Mom

What are the "survivors" of poverty? Those who:
-	Fall into trouble at an early age, but over time "turn their backs upon that life and the dangers that it held"
-	Receive "a sense of calling" to service or a job
-	"Perceive themselves as virtually unbounded in their academic goals and were looking to a future that encompassed colleges or universities"

***1993***. Leonardo, age 6, lives in the South Bronx with his mother and has chronic asthema. They live near an incinerator for medical waste, which "spewed its toxins to a wider population of approximately 40,000 people, virtually all them black or Hispanic families" (p. 149). In 1995, hospitalizations for asthema were 14x higher than East Side of Manhattan. Eventually, in 1997, the incenerator is shut down and, a year later, the owner agrees to donate money for kids to attend an "asthma camp". "Once the incinerator ceased its operations, hospitalizations for asthma in the Mott Haven area rapidly declined." (p. 158). Leonardo's also disappeared.

> But, for Leonardo, pulling out his asthma pump to take a puff or two or three when he began to wheeze, it had come to be a fairly normal part of his existence and, to all appearances, he did not let it slow him down or undermine the pleasure that he took in making observations that he may not always have intended to be quite as funny or alarming as they were.

His mother, Antsy, is a "largely self-taught intellectual". She is committed to Leonardo's education, including teaching him to read at age 4 and sending him to a neighborhood preschool. He had a 5th grade teach Miss Harrinarine ("strict but good natured") who ran a small satellite school that went into middle school, which Leonardo attended. Antsy was very involved, "She questioned teachers. She went into the classrooms." The principal of the school said "She's always in my hair" but Miss Harrinarine said she was "the kind of parent every teacher hopes for. I wish that we had more of them..." (p. 155). Antsy planned parties for her neighborhood (held at a former trap house, she even had some gang members help clean) and frequently had children over at her apartment.

Leonardo is recruited by a New England boarding school for high school. He had no problem adjusting to the academic pace, and was the captain of the football team. He went on to college and, despite struggling his first semester, graduate with a degree in sociology. During college, he worked to pay tuition and received support from his mother (sending him money and home cooked meals). His first job out of school is a managerial position at a produce market. On the side, he was writing and performing stand-up comedy acts.

While Leonardo is in college, Antsy works at a home for the mentally imparied. She is injured after breaking up a fight between staff and a patient, and is forced to quit. She fell into depression, but after surgery for her injury and antidepressants, "my spirits were restored and I didn't need the medication anymore."

> In Antsy's case, except for the time when her spinal injury forced her to stay home, she had always compensated for the inward pull -- the withdrawl from activity that's familiar to depression -- by throwing herself outward into the thick and thin of life, into the streets, into the schools, into the battle for clean air, into the battle to clean out a drug-infested block so she could have a party for her baseball team.

Leonardo tells Kozol of a friend from the Bronx who got into trouble early in life. Leonardo had him over during his time in college for two weeks. The friend attended his sociology classes and got involved.

> He saw people of his age going to their classes with their backpacks. He was amazed, after clas, to see them, with their books and laptops, lying on the grass. 'Wow!' he said. 'You got trees! You got grass!' It wasn't life he'd never seen a tree before -- it was the whole setting. Students playing Frisbee. Other students studying. Open spaces. Lots of grass! There was a pond. People looked relaxed. The main thing is, he saw people going somewhere with their lives. And he liked what he was seeing. I think that something changed in him. He didn't get in trouble for a long time after that...
