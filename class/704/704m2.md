### The Vilis Tokples Schools of Papua New Guinea

> Unlike the academic world in which I spend most of my time, in my home world, heritage -- not title and position -- is central to identity. To be disconnected from that identity means losing not only the ability to explain one's essence to others but also any potential for self-knowledge as well.
> p. 77

Delpit is in Papua New Guinea on a research project. PNG is extremely diverse, specificly in the number of languages, "over seven hundred different indigenous languages." Only 25-30% speak English. The most widely spoken language (as a second language, usually) is Tok Pisin, a "pidgin" language developed during the Australian slave trade. However, Tok Pisin has been rejected as a language in schools.

> The educational language choice in Papua New Guinea, as in many other Third World countries, has been subjected to two conflicting forces: on the one hand, serving the needs of a developing nation-state with a modern exchange economy, and, on the other, serving the welfare, development, nad cohesion of local, predominantly rural village communities.
> p. 79

Schooling and literacy is introduced mainly by missionaries, "so that converts could read the Bible in their village setting."Additionally, the colonial government wanted a workforce that could communicate with the West. However, in the 1970s, literacy and math standards were dropping. "Instead of Australian and American teachers, local Papua New Guinean teachers were forced to instruct in English, a language they barely spoke and their students understood not at all."

> What researchers began to note was that even where parents actively welcomed a transforming English- and Western-focused role for the school, seeing it as a means to bring direct social and economic benefits to the community, they were unable to anticipate the disruption to social relations between young and old in rural communities that i could entail. Traditional customs, beliefs, values, and practices were devalued, leading to a sense of powerlessness, vis-a-vis the school.
> p. 81

In 1980, a new school caled Vilis Tokples Pri-Skul was created in the Buka and Buin regions of the North Solomons. The program had three goals:

+ Teach children to read, write, count in their native language before transfering to English
+ Teach the customs, culture, values of their community
+ Teach the Western basic preschool skills in preparation for the English-based primary school

This is a "bilingual, bicultural process of education". The region has placed an importance on an understanding of the tok ples (indigenous language). "Most people believed English to be more important as a **written** language than as a **spoken** language for village life." However, there is a distaste of Tok Pisin, ranging from a necessary evil to communicate with the other regions in PNG to "The children learned Pidgin and they forgot our traditions" (p. 86).

> They wanted "what was good from the old" so as to have children feel the security of a strong cultural base, and the "best of the new" so as to allow them to enter the changing world of towns and technology.
> p. 87

Children start tokples school at age 7, have two years of preschooling, the enter English primary school at 9 for six years. Teachers are chosen by local villagers. Parents seem to like the program, noting strong literacy among students.

> The testing I conducted during my research supported the theory that children learn to read only once, and if they learn to read in a language they already understand orally, they become literate much more quickly and effectively than do those who learn in a foreign language.
> p. 88

> Parent: "He is not only reading and writing about things outside, but learning through reading and writing to be proud of our way of life. When he is big, he will not reject us. It is important to teach our children to read and write, but it is more important to teach them to be proud of themselves, and of us.
> p. 89

### "Hello, Grandfather": Lessons from Alaska

Delpit reflects on the idea of connectedness, reinforced by her time in Alaska speaking with native people's understanding of our role in the world: "to be a part of the world rather than dominate it." Part of this is an understanding of placing things in context. "In education, we set about solving educational problems as if they exist in a vacuum. We isolate the problem and then seek technical solutions." She mentions the literacy "problem" in Alaska, and the call for technical solutions (more phonics! less phonics! etc).

> In our Western academic worldview, we assume that literacy is unequivocally god, and that everyone should aspire to be literate. Most of us have not taken the time to think about possible drawbacks or political implications of this ideology. Literacy can be a tool of liberation, but, equally, it can be a means of control.
> p. 93-94

In her experiences in Alaska, Delpit notices that Native Alaskans value connectedness with people over literature, bringing up the connection between literacy and orality. Some research has contrasted the two, noticing success in teaching literacy when decontextualizing the words in a passage. However, Delpit notices that Native Alaskans in their home lives value the context in which text is said. She brings up a comparison between an Anglo teacher, who directs with words (tells children to copy words on the blackboard while standing away from it), versus a Native teacher, who directs with actions (stands by the blackboard while giving instruction).

> It would be easy to suggest that the Anglo teacher should be more consistent, but in truth he may well be unconsciously preparing children for their future schooling, where they will be expected to attend to the words and not the surrounding context. Yet, if they learn what he teaches, they could find themselves in conflict with what they learn at home.
> p. 98-99

> When children who have been brought up to trust their own observations enter school, they confront teachers, who, in their estimation, act as unbelievable tyrants. From the children's perspective, their teachers attempt to coerce behavior... Despite the rhetoric of American education, it does not teach children to be independent, but rather to be dependent on external sources for direction, for truth, for meaning. It trains children both to seek meaning solely from the text and to seek truth outside of their own good sense -- concepts that are foreign and dangerous to Alaskan village communities.
> p. 101-102

Delpit gives examples of how contextualizing a lesson can help Native Alaskan student develop literacy skills. Ex, having children write down how to make Native foods, then watching the teacher struggle following their directions. "After a while, the children learned that they could make use of decontextualized literacy when they needed to. They did notlearn, however, that they had to give up their own contextual way of experiencing the world."

> "The purpose of education is to learn to die satiated with life."
> p. 104

### Teachers' Voices: Rethinking Teacher Education for Diversity

Delpit notes how "minority" students are starting to represent a majority, yet "the current number of teachers from nonwhite groups threatens to fall below 10 percent". She cites both African-American and Native Alaskan teachers suggesting their teacher education focused on teaching white children, and that their views were not appreciated. Delpit interviews 12 teachers total (6 African-American, 6 Native Alaskan) about their experiences in their teacher education.

1. "Most of the black and Native teachers interviewed believe accounts of their own experiences are not validated in teacher education programs or in their subsequent teaching lives" (p. 108).

> First, the university does not value personal narratives as having legitimate cognitive function. Discourse in the university setting is more valued if it reflects independence of context, analysis, and objectification of experience.
> p. 109

2. "The teachers interviewed frequently encountered negative and/or stereotypical cultural and racial attitudes directed toward themselves and toward ethnic minority children" (p. 110)

Delpit categorized such frustration in four ways: bias toward children of color by nonminority teachers, bias against the teacher by parents/children, bias against the teacher by other teachers, and bias against the teacher by their teacher education (curriculum, profs, students).

> Several researchers have observed that there are large numbers of nonwhite teachers who are certified to teach but are not teaching. Consequently, those who seek to increase the numbers of teachers of coloor cannot only recruit new minority students to teacher education programs; they must identify why teachers leave the profession. If these interviews are in any way representative of the larger population, in order to recruit and retain teachers of color, schools of education must find means to address what these teachers perceive as racial discrimination during teacher education and beyond.
> p. 115

With modern prejudices being much more subtle, it will be difficult to overcome bias in education. Furthermore, "some researchers have demonstrated that bias can cause lowered performance for those who are its victims" (p. 116).

3. "The teachers interviewed report significant differences from their white colleagues in classroom pedagogy and discipline, saying that their teaching styles are most influenced by their own experiences as learners, their reflections about their students, and from the culture bearers in their community." (p. 116)

Specifically, there was a frustration that they were forced into teaching a curriculum without reflecting on how the students are learning the material (or what the students want to learn!)

4. "The teachers interviewed often felt isolated from instructors and other students during their teacher training." (p. 122)

The obvious solution is to have more nonwhite participation in teacher education, both as professors and students. In the meantime, "A Native village woman found great support from her white male instructors who provided individual attention and encouragement." We can also look to reduce tokenism in the classroom, "when a single individual is viewed as a representative of a low status group" (p. 124).

Delpit proposes that encouraging students (and student teachers) to bring their past experiences and knowledge will reduce the conflict brought up in the interviews.

> Dewey recommends that students be encouraged to bring their personal experiences to bear upon subject matter presented in the classroom. Doing otherwise, he warns, prevents teachers from developing and using their own independent intelligence and reinforces their "intellectual subserviency." Dewey further advises that failure to allow students to explore their past experiences in light of theoretical constructs will produce only a mindless imitation of others' practice rather than a reflection on teaching as an interactive process.
